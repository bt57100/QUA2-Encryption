# QUA2 Encryption

![Build](https://travis-ci.org/bt57100/QUA2-Encryption.svg?branch=master)

Simple project for ECE QUA2 class:  
This application is used to encrypt and decrypt data.  
Two algorithms can be used: Cesar and an extended Vigenère, using characters from ' ' (space) to '~' (tilde) in the ASCII table. Special characters such as accentuated letters can not be used. You can choose how many of these algorithms you use.

## Tests
A set of test have been incorporated in order to ensure the algorithms are working according to what is expected.
